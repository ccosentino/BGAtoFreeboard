# BGAtoFreeboard 

Made a GitHub repo so it will be easier to share. Here is the idea:

0. Start on the player history page for Quoridor games (ex. WickedBad's page http://en.boardgamearena.com/#!gamestats?player=32231182&opponent_id=0&game_id=43&finished=1)
0. Access the first game.
0. Choose 'Replay this game'
0. Choose the player (ex. Wickedbad)
0. Feed this page into main.py (this will return a list of moves for the game)
0. Feed this list into the freeboard.
0. Add the game number, player names, and freeboard input code to a database.
0. Repeat with the next game.

Some other ideas. 

* It would be nice if we could control how many games we want to look at
* It would be nice if we could control who the opponent was
* When I tried this the first time I couldn't access the replay page (step 5) from python on my laptop. I had to login first. Not sure how to solve this
